# assignAPotluckDish
Created with CodeSandbox
To make choosing a potluck dish easier, I used functions, a for...of loop, an array, and the Math object to randomly assign a dish to my invitees by using JavaScript.

After I assigned the dishes to my guests, I wrote code to prevent assigning dishes twice. In this code, I used the disabled property to indicate if an element could be interacted with using a boolean value of true or false. For example, if the disabled property is set to true for a button, the user can no longer click the button.
